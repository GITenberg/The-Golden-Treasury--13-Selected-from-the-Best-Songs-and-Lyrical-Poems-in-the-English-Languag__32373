<p>This book in its progress has recalled often to my memory a man with
whose friendship we were once honoured, to whom no region of English
Literature was unfamiliar, and who, whilst rich in all the noble gifts
of Nature, was most eminently distinguished by the noblest and the
rarest,&mdash;just judgment and high-hearted patriotism. It would have been
hence a peculiar pleasure and pride to dedicate what I have
endeavoured to make a true national Anthology of three centuries to
Henry Hallam. But he is beyond the reach of any human tokens of love
and reverence; and I desire therefore to place before it a name united
with his by associations which, while Poetry retains her hold on the
minds of Englishmen, are not likely to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Your encouragement, given while traversing the wild scenery of Treryn
Dinas, led me to begin the work; and it has been completed under your
advice and assistance. For the favour now asked I have thus a second
reason: and to this I may add, the homage which is your right as Poet,
and the gratitude due to a Friend, whose regard I rate at no common
value.</p>

<p>Permit me then to inscribe to yourself a book which, I hope, may be
found by many a lifelong fountain of innocent and exalted pleasure; a
source of animation to friends when they meet; and able to sweeten
solitude itself with best society,&mdash;with the companionship of the wise
and the good, with the beauty which the eye cannot see, and the music
only heard in silence. If this Collection proves a store-house of
delight to Labour and to Poverty,&mdash;if it teaches those indifferent to
the Poets to love them, and those who love them to love them more, the
aim and the desire entertained in framing it will be fully
accomplished.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This little Collection differs, it is believed, from others in the
attempt made to include in it all the best original Lyrical pieces and
Songs in our language (save a very few regretfully omitted on account
of length), by writers not living,&mdash;and none beside the best. Many
familiar verses will hence be met with; many also which should be
familiar:&mdash;the Editor will regard as his fittest readers those who
love Poetry so well, that he can offer them nothing not already known
and valued.</p>

<p>The Editor is acquainted with no strict and exhaustive definition of
Lyrical Poetry; but he has found the task of practical decision
increase in clearness and in facility as he advanced with the work,
whilst keeping in view a few simple principles. Lyrical has been here
held essentially to imply that each Poem shall turn on some single
thought, feeling, or situation. In accordance with this, narrative,
descriptive, and didactic poems,&mdash;unless accompanied by rapidity of
movement, brevity, and the colouring of human passion,&mdash;have been
excluded. Humourous poetry, except in the very unfrequent instances
where a truly poetical tone pervades the whole, with what is strictly
personal, occasional, and religious, has been considered foreign to
the idea of the book. Blank verse and the ten-syllable couplet, with
all pieces markedly dramatic, have been rejected as alien from what is
commonly understood by Song, and rarely conforming to Lyrical
conditions in treatment. But it is not anticipated, nor is it
possible, that all readers shall think the line accurately drawn. Some
poems, as Gray's Elegy, the Allegro and Penseroso, Wordsworth's Ruth
or Campbell's Lord Ullin, might be claimed with perhaps equal justice
for a narrative or descriptive selection: whilst with reference
especially to Ballads and Sonnets, the Editor can only state that he
has taken his utmost pains to decide without caprice or partiality.</p>

<p>This also is all he can plead in regard to a point even more liable to
question;&mdash;what degree of merit should give rank among the Best. That
a poem shall be worthy of the writer's genius,&mdash;that it shall reach a
perfection commensurate with its aim,&mdash;that we should require finish
in proportion to brevity,&mdash;that passion, colour, and originality
cannot atone for serious imperfections in clearness, unity or
truth,&mdash;that a few good lines do not make a good poem, that popular
estimate is serviceable as a guidepost more than as a compass,&mdash;above
all, that excellence should be looked for rather in the whole than in
the parts,&mdash;such and other such canons have been always steadily
regarded. He may however add that the pieces chosen, and a far larger
number rejected, have been carefully and repeatedly considered; and
that he has been aided throughout by two friends of independent and
exercised judgment, besides the distinguished person addressed in the
Dedication. It is hoped that by this procedure the volume has been
freed from that one-sidedness which must beset individual
decisions:&mdash;but for the final choice the Editor is alone responsible.</p>

<p>Chalmers' vast collection, with the whole works of all accessible
poets not contained in it, and the best Anthologies of different
periods, have been twice systematically read through: and it is hence
improbable that any omissions which may be regretted are due to
oversight. The poems are printed entire, except in a very few
instances where a stanza or passage has been omitted. These omissions
have been risked only when the piece could be thus brought to a closer
lyrical unity: and, as essentially opposed to this unity, extracts,
obviously such, are excluded. In regard to the text, the purpose of
the book has appeared to justify the choice of the most poetical
version, wherever more than one exists; and much labour has been given
to present each poem, in disposition, spelling, and punctuation, to
the greatest advantage.</p>

<p>In the arrangement, the most poetically-effective order has been
attempted. The English mind has passed through phases of thought and
cultivation so various and so opposed during these three centuries of
Poetry, that a rapid passage between old and new, like rapid
alteration of the eye's focus in looking at the landscape, will always
be wearisome and hurtful to the sense of Beauty. The poems have been
therefore distributed into Books corresponding, I to the ninety years
closing about 1616, II thence to 1700, III to 1800, IV to the half
century just ended. Or, looking at the Poets who more or less give
each portion its distinctive character, they might be called the Books
of Shakespeare, Milton, Gray, and Wordsworth. The volume, in this
respect, so far as the limitations of its range allow, accurately
reflects the natural growth and evolution of our Poetry. A rigidly
chronological sequence, however, rather fits a collection aiming at
instruction than at pleasure, and the wisdom which comes through
pleasure:&mdash;within each book the pieces have therefore been arranged in
gradations of feeling or subject. And it is hoped that the contents of
this Anthology will thus be found to present a certain unity, 'as
episodes,' in the noble language of Shelley, 'to that great Poem which
all poets, like the co-operating thoughts of one great mind, have
built up since the beginning of the world.'</p>

<p>As he closes his long survey, the Editor trusts he may add without
egotism, that he has found the vague general verdict of popular Fame
more just than those have thought, who, with too severe a criticism,
would confine judgments on Poetry to 'the selected few of many
generations.' Not many appear to have gained reputation without some
gift or performance that, in due degree, deserved it: and if no verses
by certain writers who show less strength than sweetness, or more
thought than mastery of expression, are printed in this volume, it
should not be imagined that they have been excluded without much
hesitation and regret,&mdash;far less that they have been slighted.
Throughout this vast and pathetic array of Singers now silent, few
have been honoured with the name Poet, and have not possessed a skill
in words, a sympathy with beauty, a tenderness of feeling, or
seriousness in reflection, which render their works, although never
perhaps attaining that loftier and finer excellence here
required,&mdash;better worth reading than much of what fills the scanty
hours that most men spare for self-improvement, or for pleasure in any
of its more elevated and permanent forms.&mdash;And if this be true of even
mediocre poetry, for how much more are we indebted to the best! Like
the fabled fountain of the Azores, but with a more various power, the
magic of this Art can confer on each period of life its appropriate
blessing: on early years Experience, on maturity Calm, on age,
Youthfulness. Poetry gives treasures 'more golden than gold,' leading
us in higher and healthier ways than those of the world, and
interpreting to us the lessons of Nature. But she speaks best for
herself. Her true accents, if the plan has been executed with success,
may be heard throughout the following pages:&mdash;wherever the Poets of
England are honoured, wherever the dominant language of the world is
spoken, it is hoped that they will find fit audience.</p>

<p class="p2">1861</p>

<p>Some poems, especially in Book I, have been added:&mdash;either on better
acquaintance;&mdash;in deference to critical suggestions;&mdash;or unknown to
the Editor when first gathering his harvest. For aid in these
after-gleanings he is specially indebted to the excellent reprints of
rare early verse given us by Dr. Hannah, Dr. Grosart, Mr. Arber, Mr.
Bullen, and others,&mdash;and (in regard to the additions of 1883) to the
advice of that distinguished Friend, by whom the final choice has been
so largely guided. The text has also been carefully revised from
authoritative sources. It has still seemed best, for many reasons, to
retain the original limit by which the selection was confined to those
then no longer living. But the editor hopes that, so far as in him
lies, a complete and definitive collection of our best Lyrics, to the
central year of this fast-closing century, is now offered.</p>

<span class="i0">The Gospel's pearl upon our coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in these rocks for us did frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A temple where to sound His name.<br /></span>

<h3><i>Summary of Book First</i></h3>
<p>The Elizabethan Poetry, as it is rather vaguely termed, forms the
substance of this Book, which contains pieces from Wyat under Henry
VIII to Shakespeare midway through the reign of James I, and Drummond
who carried on the early manner to a still later period. There is here
a wide range of style;&mdash;from simplicity expressed in a language hardly
yet broken-in to verse,&mdash;through the pastoral fancies and Italian
conceits of the strictly Elizabethan time,&mdash;to the passionate reality
of Shakespeare: yet a general uniformity of tone prevails. Few readers
can fail to observe the natural sweetness of the verse, the
single-hearted straightforwardness of the thoughts:&mdash;nor less, the
limitation of subject to the many phases of one passion, which then
characterized our lyrical poetry,&mdash;unless when, as in especial with
Shakespeare, the 'purple light of Love' is tempered by a spirit of
sterner reflection. For the didactic verse of the century, although
lyrical in form, yet very rarely rises to the pervading emotion, the
golden cadence, proper to the lyric.</p>

<p>It should be observed that this and the following Summaries apply in
the main to the Collection here presented, in which (besides its
restriction to Lyrical Poetry) a strictly representative or historical
Anthology has not been aimed at. Great excellence, in human art as in
human character, has from the beginning of things been even more
uniform than mediocrity, by virtue of the closeness of its approach to
Nature:&mdash;and so far as the standard of Excellence kept in view has
been attained in this volume, a comparative absence of extreme or
temporary phases in style, a similarity of tone and manner, will be
found throughout:&mdash;something neither modern nor ancient, but true and
speaking to the heart of man alike throughout all ages.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;3 <i>whist</i>: hushed, quieted.</p>

<p>&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 <i>Rouse Memnon's mother</i>: Awaken the Dawn from the dark Earth and
the clouds where she is resting. This is one of that limited class of
early mythes which may be reasonably interpreted as representations of
natural phenomena. Aurora in the old mythology is mother of Memnon
(the East), and wife of Tithonus (the appearances of Earth and Sky
during the last hours of Night). She leaves him every morning in
renewed youth, to prepare the way for Phoebus (the Sun), whilst
Tithonus remains in perpetual old age and grayness.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; l. 23 <i>by Peneus' stream</i>: Phoebus loved the Nymph Daphne whom he
met by the river Peneus in the vale of Tempe. L. 27 <i>Amphion's lyre</i>:
He was said to have built the walls of Thebes to the sound of his
music. L. 35 <i>Night like a drunkard reels</i>: Compare Romeo and Juliet,
Act II, Scene 3: 'The grey-eyed morn smiles,' &amp;c.&mdash;It should be added
that three lines, which appeared hopelessly misprinted, have been
omitted in this Poem.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_4">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;6 <i>Time's chest</i>: in which he is figuratively supposed to lay up
past treasures. So in Troilus, Act III, Scene 3, 'Time hath a wallet
at his back' &amp;c. In the <i>Arcadia</i>, <i>chest</i> is used to signify <i>tomb</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;7 A fine example of the high wrought and conventional Elizabethan
Pastoralism, which it would be unreasonable to criticize on the ground
of the unshepherdlike or unreal character of some images suggested.
Stanza 6 was perhaps inserted by Izaak Walton.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;8 This beautiful lyric is one of several recovered from the very
rare Elizabethan Song-books, for the publication of which our thanks
are due to Mr. A. H. Bullen (1887, 1888).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_8">8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;12 One stanza has been here omitted, in accordance with the
principle noticed in the Preface. Similar omissions occur in a few
other poems. The more serious abbreviation by which it has been
attempted to bring Crashaw's 'Wishes' and Shelley's 'Euganean Hills,'
with one or two more, within the scheme of this selection, is
commended with much diffidence to the judgment of readers acquainted
with the original pieces.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_9">9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;13 Sidney's poetry is singularly unequal; his short life, his
frequent absorption in public employment, hindered doubtless the
development of his genius. His great contemporary fame, second only,
it appears, to Spenser's, has been hence obscured. At times he is
heavy and even prosaic; his simplicity is rude and bare; his verse
unmelodious. These, however, are the 'defects of his merits.' In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span> a
certain depth and chivalry of feeling,&mdash;in the rare and noble quality
of disinterestedness (to put it in one word),&mdash;he has no superior,
hardly perhaps an equal, amongst our Poets; and after or beside
Shakespeare's Sonnets, his <i>Astrophel and Stella</i>, in the Editor's
judgment, offers the most intense and powerful picture of the passion
of love in the whole range of our poetry.&mdash;<i>Hundreds of years</i>: 'The
very rapture of love,' says Mr. Ruskin; 'A lover like this does not
believe his mistress can grow old or die.'</p>

<p><a href="#Page_12">12</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;19 Readers who have visited Italy will be reminded of more than one
picture by this gorgeous Vision of Beauty, equally sublime and pure in
its Paradisaical naturalness. Lodge wrote it on a voyage to 'the
Islands of Terceras and the Canaries;' and he seems to have caught, in
those southern seas, no small portion of the qualities which marked
the almost contemporary Art of Venice,&mdash;the glory and the glow of
Veronese, Titian, or Tintoret.&mdash;From the same romance is No. 71: a
charming picture in the purest style of the later Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p><i>The clear</i> (l. 1) is the crystalline or outermost heaven of the old
cosmography. <i>For a fair there's fairer none</i>: If you desire a Beauty,
there is none more beautiful than Rosaline.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_14">14</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 22 Another gracious lyric from an Elizabethan Song-book, first
reprinted (it is believed) in Mr. W. J. Linton's 'Rare Poems,' in
1883.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_15">15</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 23 <i>that fair thou owest</i>: that beauty thou ownest.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_16">16</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 From one of the three Song-books of T. Campion, who appears to
have been author of the words which he set to music. His merit as a
lyrical poet (recognized in his own time, but since then forgotten)
has been again brought to light by Mr. Bullen's taste and
research:&mdash;<i>swerving</i> (st. 2) is his conjecture for <i>changing</i> in the
text of 1601.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_20">20</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 31 <i>the star Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken</i>:
apparently, Whose stellar influence is uncalculated, although his
angular altitude from the plane of the astrolabe or artificial horizon
used by astrologers has been determined.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_20">20</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 32 This lovely song appears, as here given, in Puttenham's 'Arte of
English Poesie,' 1589. A longer and inferior form was published in the
'Arcadia' of 1590: but Puttenham's prefatory words clearly assign his
version to Sidney's own authorship.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_23">23</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 37 <i>keel</i>: keep cooler by stirring round.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_24">24</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 39 <i>expense</i>: loss.</p>

<p>&mdash; 40 <i>prease</i>: press.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_25">25</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 41 <i>Nativity, once in the main of light</i>: when a star has risen and
entered on the full stream of light;&mdash;another of the astrological
phrases no longer familiar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Crooked</i> eclipses: as coming athwart the Sun's apparent course.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, thinking probably of the 'Venus' and the 'Lucrece,' said
finely of Shakespeare: 'Shakespeare <i>could</i> not have written an Epic;
he would have died of plethora of thought.' This prodigality of nature
is exemplified equally in his Sonnets. The copious selection here
given (which from the wealth of the material, required greater
consideration than any other portion of the Editor's task),&mdash;contains
many that will not be fully felt and understood without some
earnestness of thought on the reader's part. But he is not likely to
regret the labour.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_26">26</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 42 <i>upon misprision growing</i>: either, granted in error, or, on the
growth of contempt.</p>

<p>&mdash; 43 With the tone of this Sonnet compare Hamlet's 'Give me that man
That is not passion's slave' &amp;c. Shakespeare's writings show the
deepest sensitiveness to passion:&mdash;hence the attraction he felt in the
contrasting effects of apathy.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_26">26</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 44 <i>grame</i>: sorrow. Renaissance influences long impeded the return
of English poets to the charming realism of this and a few other poems
by Wyat.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_28">28</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 45 Pandion in the ancient fable was father to Philomela.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_29">29</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 47 In the old legend it is now Philomela, now Procne (the swallow)
who suffers violence from Tereus. This song has a fascination in its
calm intensity of passion; that 'sad earnestness and vivid exactness'
which Cardinal Newman ascribes to the master-pieces of ancient poetry.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_31">31</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 <i>proved</i>: approved.</p>

<p>&mdash; 51 <i>censures</i>: judges.</p>

<p>&mdash; 52 Exquisite in its equably-balanced metrical flow.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_32">32</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 53 Judging by its style, this beautiful example of old simplicity
and feeling may, perhaps, be referred to the earlier years of
Elizabeth. <i>Late</i> forgot: lately.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_35">35</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 57 Printed in a little Anthology by Nicholas Breton, 1597. It is,
however, a stronger and finer piece of work than any known to be
his.&mdash;St. 1 <i>silly</i>: simple; <i>dole</i>: grief; <i>chief</i>: chiefly. St. 3
<i>If there be</i> ...: obscure: Perhaps, if there be any who speak harshly
of thee, thy pain may plead for pity from Fate.</p>

<p>This poem, with 60 and 143, are each graceful variations of a long
popular theme.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_36">36</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 58 <i>That busy archer:</i> Cupid. <i>Descries</i>: used actively; <i>points
out</i>.&mdash;'The last line of this poem is a little obscured by
transposition. He means, <i>Do they call ungratefulness there a
virtue?</i>' (C. Lamb).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_37">37</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 59 <i>White Iope</i>: suggested, Mr. Bullen notes, by a passage in
Propertius (iii, 20) describing Spirits in the lower world:</p>

whether from the French <i>crespe</i> or from the Island whence it was
imported. Its accidental similarity in spelling to <i>cypress</i> has, here

<h3><i>Summary of Book Second.</i></h3>

<p>This division, embracing generally the latter eighty years of the
Seventeenth century, contains the close of our Early poetical style
and the commencement of the Modern. In Dryden we see the first master
of the new: in Milton, whose genius dominates here as Shakespeare's in
the former book,&mdash;the crown and consummation of the early period.
Their splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span> Odes are far in advance of any prior attempts,
Spenser's excepted: they exhibit that wider and grander range which
years and experience and the struggles of the time conferred on
Poetry. Our Muses now give expression to political feeling, to
religious thought, to a high philosophic statesmanship in writers such
as Marvell, Herbert, and Wotton: whilst in Marvell and Milton, again,
we find noble attempts, hitherto rare in our literature, at pure
description of nature, destined in our own age to be continued and
equalled. Meanwhile the poetry of simple passion, although before 1660
often deformed by verbal fancies and conceits of thought, and
afterwards by levity and an artificial tone,&mdash;produced in Herrick and
Waller some charming pieces of more finished art than the Elizabethan:
until in the courtly compliments of Sedley it seems to exhaust itself,
and lie almost dormant for the hundred years between the days of
Wither and Suckling and the days of Burns and Cowper.&mdash;That the change
from our early style to the modern brought with it at first a loss of
nature and simplicity is undeniable; yet the bolder and wider scope
which Poetry took between 1620 and 1700, and the successful efforts
then made to gain greater clearness in expression, in their results
have been no slight compensation.</p>

confusion with Apis, figured as a Bull), was torn to pieces by Typho and
embalmed after death in a sacred chest. This mythe, reproduced in Syria
and Greece in the legends of Thammuz, Adonis, and perhaps Absyrtus, may
have originally signified the annual death of the Sun or the Year under
the influences of the winter darkness. Horus, the son of Osiris, as the
New Year, in his turn overcomes Typho. L. 8 <i>unshower'd</i> grass: as watered

by the Duke of Savoy. No more mighty Sonnet than this 'collect in
verse,' as it has been justly named, probably can be found in any
language. Readers should observe that it is constructed on the
original Italian or Proven&ccedil;al model. This form, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> language such as
ours, not affluent in rhyme, presents great difficulties; the rhymes
are apt to be forced, or the substance commonplace. But, when
successfully handled, it has a unity and a beauty of effect which
place the strict Sonnet above the less compact and less lyrical
systems adopted by Shakespeare, Sidney, Spenser, and other Elizabethan
poets.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_65">65</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 88 Cromwell returned from Ireland in 1650, and Marvell probably
wrote his lines soon after, whilst living at Nunappleton in the
Fairfax household. It is hence not surprising that (st. 21-24) he
should have been deceived by Cromwell's professed submissiveness to
the Parliament which, when it declined to register his decrees, he
expelled by armed violence:&mdash;one despotism, by natural law, replacing
another. The poet's insight has, however, truly prophesied that result
in his last two lines.</p>

<p>This Ode, beyond doubt one of the finest in our language, and more in
Milton's style than has been reached by any other poet, is
occasionally obscure from imitation of the condensed Latin syntax. The
meaning of st. 5 is 'rivalry or hostility are the same to a lofty
spirit, and limitation more hateful than opposition.' The allusion in
st. 11 is to the old physical doctrines of the non-existence of a
vacuum and the impenetrability of matter:&mdash;in st. 17 to the omen
traditionally connected with the foundation of the Capitol at
Rome:&mdash;<i>forced</i>, fated. The ancient belief that certain years in life
complete natural periods and are hence peculiarly exposed to death, is
introduced in st. 26 by the word <i>climacteric</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_68">68</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 89 <i>Lycidas</i>: The person here lamented is Milton's college
contemporary, Edward King, drowned in 1637 whilst crossing from
Chester to Ireland.</p>

<p>Strict Pastoral Poetry was first written or perfected by the Dorian
Greeks settled in Sicily: but the conventional use of it, exhibited
more magnificently in <i>Lycidas</i> than in any other pastoral, is
apparently of Roman origin. Milton, employing the noble freedom of a
great artist, has here united ancient mythology, with what may be
called the modern mythology of Camus and Saint Peter,&mdash;to direct
Christian images. Yet the poem, if it gains in historical interest,
suffers in poetry by the harsh intrusion of the writer's narrow and
violent theological politics.&mdash;The metrical structure of this glorious
elegy is partly derived from Italian models.</p>

Hellenic mythology render some feature in the natural landscape, which
the Greeks studied and analysed with their usual unequalled insight
and feeling. <i>Panope</i> seems to express the boundlessness of the
ocean-horizon when seen from a height, as compared with the limited
sky-line of the land in hilly countries such as Greece or Asia Minor.

the Dog-star, called swarthy because its heliacal rising in ancient
times occurred soon after midsummer: l. 19 <i>rathe</i>: early. L. 36

<i>Bellerus</i> (l. 37) a giant, apparently created here by Milton to
personify Belerium, the ancient title of the Land's End. <i>The great
Vision</i>:&mdash;the story was that the Archangel Michael had appeared on the
rock by Marazion in Mount's Bay which bears his name. Milton calls on
him to turn his eyes from the south homeward, and to pity Lycidas, if
his body has drifted into the troubled waters off the Land's End.
Finisterre being the land due south of Marazion, two places in that
district (then through our trade with Corunna probably less unfamiliar
to English ears), are named,&mdash;<i>Namancos</i> now Mujio in Galicia,

<p><a href="#Page_112">112</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 141 Perhaps no poem in this collection is more delicately fancied,
more exquisitely finished. By placing his description of the Fawn in a
young girl's mouth, Marvell has, as it were, legitimated that
abundance of 'imaginative hyperbole' to which he is always partial: he
makes us feel it natural that a maiden's favourite should be whiter
than milk, sweeter than sugar&mdash;'lilies without, roses within,' The
poet's imagination is justified in its seeming extravagance by the
intensity and unity with which it invests his picture.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_113">113</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 142 The remark quoted in the note to No. 65 applies equally to

<h3><i>Summary of Book Third</i></h3>

<p>It is more difficult to characterize the English Poetry of the
Eighteenth century than that of any other. For it was an age not only
of spontaneous transition, but of bold experiment: it includes not
only such absolute contrasts as distinguish the 'Rape of the Lock'
from the 'Parish Register,' but such vast contemporaneous differences
as lie between Pope and Collins, Burns and Cowper. Yet we may clearly
trace three leading moods or tendencies:&mdash;the aspects of courtly or
educated life represented by Pope and carried to exhaustion by his
followers; the poetry of Nature and of Man, viewed through a
cultivated, and at the same time an impassioned frame of mind by
Collins and Gray:&mdash;lastly, the study of vivid and simple narrative,
including natural description, begun by Gay and Thomson, pursued by
Burns and others in the north, and established in England by
Goldsmith, Percy, Crabbe, and Cowper. Great varieties in style
accompanied these diversities in aim: poets could not always
distinguish the manner suitable for subjects so far apart: and the
union of conventional and of common language, exhibited most
conspicuously by Burns, has given a tone to the poetry of that century
which is better explained by reference to its historical origin than
by naming it artificial. There is, again, a nobleness of thought, a
courageous aim at high and, in a strict sense manly, excellence in
many of the writers:&mdash;nor can that period be justly termed tame and
wanting in originality, which produced poems such as Pope's Satires,
Gray's Odes and Elegy, the ballads of Gay and Carey, the songs of
Burns and Cowper. In truth Poetry at this, as at all times, was a more
or less unconscious mirror of the genius of the age: and the many
complex causes which made the Eighteenth century the turning-time in
modern European civilization are also more or less reflected in its
verse. An intelligent reader will find the influence of Newton as
markedly in the poems of Pope, as of Elizabeth in the plays of
Shakespeare. On this great subject, however, these indications must
here be sufficient.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_134">134</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 153 We have no poet more marked by rapture, by the ecstasy which
Plato held the note of genuine inspiration, than Collins. Yet but
twice or thrice do his lyrics reach that simplicity, that <i>sinceram
sermonis Attici gratiam</i> to which this ode testifies his enthusiastic
devotion. His style, as his friend Dr. Johnson truly remarks, was
obscure; his diction often harsh and unskilfully laboured; he
struggles nobly against the narrow, artificial manner of his age, but
his too scanty years did not allow him to reach perfect mastery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span> St.

<p><i>The Bard.</i> In 1757, when this splendid ode was completed, so very
little had been printed, whether in Wales or in England, in regard to
Welsh poetry, that it is hard to discover whence Gray drew his Cymric
allusions. The fabled massacre of the Bards (shown to be wholly
groundless in Stephens' <i>Literature of the Kymry</i>) appears first in
the family history of Sir John Wynn of Gwydir (cir. 1600), not
published till 1773; but the story seems to have passed in MS. to
Carte's History, whence it may have been taken by Gray. The references
to <i>high-born Hoel</i> and <i>soft Llewellyn</i>; to <i>Cadwallo</i> and <i>Urien</i>;
may, similarly, have been derived from the 'Specimens' of early Welsh
poetry, by the Rev. E. Evans:&mdash;as, although not published till 1764,
the MS., we learn from a letter to Dr. Wharton, was in Gray's hands by
July 1760, and may have reached him by 1757. It is, however, doubtful
whether Gray (of whose acquaintance with Welsh we have no evidence)
must not have been also aided by some Welsh scholar. He is one of the
poets least likely to scatter epithets at random: 'soft' or gentle is
the epithet emphatically and specially given to Llewelyn in
contemporary Welsh poetry, and is hence here used with particular
propriety. Yet, without such assistance as we have suggested, Gray
could hardly have selected the epithet, although applied to the King
(p. 141-3) among a crowd of others, in Llygad Gwr's Ode, printed by
Evans.&mdash;After lamenting his comrades (st. 2, 3) the Bard prophesies
the fate of Edward II, and the conquests of Edward III (4): his death
and that of the Black Prince (5): of Richard II, with the wars of York
and Lancaster, the murder of Henry VI (<i>the meek usurper</i>), and of
Edward V and his brother (6). He turns to the glory and prosperity
following the accession of the Tudors (7), through Elizabeth's reign
(8): and concludes with a vision of the poetry of Shakespeare and
Milton.</p>

no <i>data</i> for this name, which Gray (it has been supposed) uses for

departed. L. 22 <i>Arvon</i>: the shores of Carnarvonshire opposite

contemporaries at the close of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Gray, whose penetrating and powerful genius rendered him in many ways
an initiator in advance of his age, is probably the first of our poets
who made some acquaintance with the rich and admirable poetry in which
Wales from the Sixth Century has been fertile,&mdash;before and since his
time so barbarously neglected, not in England only. Hence it has been
thought worth while here to enter into a little detail upon his Cymric

his mind superior to any other of its class in melody and pathos. Part
is probably not later than the seventeenth century: in other stanzas a

total loss was believed to be nearly 1000 souls.&mdash;This little poem
might be called one of our trial-pieces, in regard to taste. The
reader who feels the vigour of description and the force of pathos
underlying Cowper's bare and truly Greek simplicity of phrase, may
assure himself <i>se valde profecisse</i> in poetry.</p>

Sonnet, which, with 204, records Cowper's gratitude to the Lady whose
affectionate care for many years gave what sweetness he could enjoy to
a life radically wretched. Petrarch's sonnets have a more ethereal
grace and a more perfect finish; Shakespeare's more passion; Milton's
stand supreme in stateliness; Wordsworth's in depth and delicacy. But
Cowper's unites with an exquisiteness in the turn of thought which the
ancients would have called Irony, an intensity of pathetic tenderness
peculiar to his loving and ingenuous nature.&mdash;There is much mannerism,
much that is unimportant or of now exhausted interest in his poems:

rests on the most universal human feelings. Cowper is our highest

<h3><i>Summary of Book Fourth</i></h3>

<p>It proves sufficiently the lavish wealth of our own age in Poetry,
that the pieces which, without conscious departure from the standard
of Excellence, render this Book by far the longest, were with very few
exceptions composed during the first thirty years of the Nineteenth
century. Exhaustive reasons can hardly be given for the strangely
sudden appearance of individual genius: that, however, which assigns
the splendid national achievements of our recent poetry to an impulse
from the France of the first Republic and Empire is inadequate. The
first French Revolution was rather one result,&mdash;the most conspicuous,
indeed, yet itself in great measure essentially retrogressive,&mdash;of
that wider and more potent spirit which through enquiry and attempt,
through strength and weakness, sweeps mankind round the circles (not,
as some too confidently argue, of Advance, but) of gradual
Transformation: and it is to this that we must trace the literature of
Modern Europe. But, without attempting discussion on the motive causes
of Scott, Wordsworth, Shelley, and others, we may observe that these
Poets carried to further perfection the later tendencies of the
Century preceding, in simplicity of narrative, reverence for human
Passion and Character in every sphere, and love of Nature for
herself:&mdash;that, whilst maintaining on the whole the advances in art
made since the Restoration, they renewed the half-forgotten melody and
depth of tone which marked the best Elizabethan writers:&mdash;that,
lastly, to what was thus inherited they added a richness in language
and a variety in metre, a force and fire in narrative, a tenderness
and bloom in feeling, an insight into the finer passages of the Soul
and the inner meanings of the landscape, a larger sense of
Humanity,&mdash;hitherto scarcely attained, and perhaps unattainable even
by predecessors of not inferior individual genius. In a word, the
Nation which, after the Greeks in their glory, may fairly claim that
during six centuries it has proved itself the most richly gifted of
all nations for Poetry, expressed in these men the highest strength
and prodigality of its nature. They interpreted the age to
itself&mdash;hence the many phases of thought and style they present:&mdash;to
sympathize with each, fervently and impartially, without fear and
without fancifulness, is no doubtful step in the higher education of
the soul. For purity in taste is absolutely proportionate to
strength&mdash;and when once the mind has raised itself to grasp and to
delight in excellence, those who love most will be found to love most
wisely.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_197">197</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 208 This beautiful lyric, printed in 1783, seems to anticipate in
its imaginative music that return to our great early age of song,
which in Blake's own lifetime was to prove,&mdash;how gloriously! that the
English Muses had resumed their 'ancient melody':&mdash;Keats, Shelley,
Byron,&mdash;he overlived them all.</p>

may be noticed, that to find in Chapman's Homer the 'pure serene' of
the original, the reader must bring with him the imagination of the
youthful poet;&mdash;he must be 'a Greek himself,' as Shelley finely said
of Keats.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_203">203</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 213 This poem exemplifies the peculiar skill with which Scott
employs proper names:&mdash;a rarely misleading sign of true poetical
genius.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_213">213</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 226 Simple as <i>Lucy Gray</i> seems, a mere narrative of what 'has
been, and may be again,' yet every touch in the child's picture is
marked by the deepest and purest ideal character. Hence, pathetic as
the situation is, this is not strictly a pathetic poem, such as
Wordsworth gives us in 221, Lamb in 264, and Scott in his <i>Maid of
Neidpath</i>,&mdash;'almost more pathetic,' as Tennyson once remarked, 'than a
man has the right to be.' And Lyte's lovely stanzas (224) suggest,
perhaps, the same remark.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_222">222</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 235 In this and in other instances the addition (or the change) of
a Title has been risked, in hope that the aim of the piece following
may be grasped more clearly and immediately.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_228">228</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 242 This beautiful Sonnet was the last word of a youth, in whom,
if the fulfilment may ever safely be prophesied from the promise,
England lost one of the most rarely gifted in the long roll of her
poets. Shakespeare and Milton, had their lives been closed at
twenty-five, would (so far as we know) have left poems of less
excellence and hope than the youth who, from the petty school and the
London surgery, passed at once to a place with them of 'high
collateral glory.'</p>

<p><a href="#Page_230">230</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 245 It is impossible not to regret that Moore has written so

worthy to stand near Milton's on the Vaudois massacre.</p>

lovely than this little song, which unites simplicity and dramatic
power to a wild-wood music of the rarest quality. No moral is drawn,
far less any conscious analysis of feeling attempted:&mdash;the pathetic
meaning is left to be suggested by the mere presentment of the
situation. A narrow criticism has often named this, which maybe called
the Homeric manner, superficial, from its apparent simple facility;
but first-rate excellence in it is in truth one of the least common
triumphs of Poetry.&mdash;This style should be compared with what is not
less perfect in its way, the searching out of inner feeling, the
expression of hidden meanings, the revelation of the heart of Nature
and of the Soul within the Soul,&mdash;the analytical method, in
short,&mdash;most completely represented by Wordsworth and by Shelley.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_263">263</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 277 Wolfe resembled Keats, not only in his early death by

spirit of his art given by these great Poets:&mdash;of that Idea which, as
in the case of the true Painter, (to quote the words of Reynolds,)
'subsists only in the mind: The sight never beheld it, nor has the
hand expressed it: it is an idea residing in the breast of the artist,
which he is always labouring to impart, and which he dies at last
without imparting.'</p>

<p><a href="#Page_331">331</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 328 st. 4 <i>this</i> folk: <i>its</i> has been here plausibly but, perhaps,
unnecessarily, conjectured.&mdash;Every one knows the general story of the
Italian Renaissance, of the Revival of Letters.&mdash;From Petrarch's day
to our own, that ancient world has renewed its youth: Poets and
artists, students and thinkers, have yielded themselves wholly to its
fascination, and deeply penetrated its spirit. Yet perhaps no one more
truly has vivified, whilst idealizing, the picture of Greek country
life in the fancied Golden Age, than Keats in these lovely (if
somewhat unequally executed) stanzas:&mdash;his quick imagination, by a
kind of 'natural magic,' more than supplying the scholarship which his
youth had no opportunity of gaining.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_105">105</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 134 These stanzas are by Richard Verstegan (&mdash;c. 1635), a poet and
antiquarian, published in his rare Odes (1601), under the title <i>Our
Blessed Ladies Lullaby</i>, and reprinted by Mr. Orby Shipley in his
beautiful <i>Carmina Mariana</i> (1893). The four stanzas here given form
the opening of a hymn of twenty-four.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
